Check for triples in HSBGs.

To authorize, we need to:
-make a client credentials post request to receive an access token
-store the access token in our app
-provide the access token via an authorization header when requesting data
-access token is valid for 24 hours.



To get relevant information, we need a data flow:
-splash page/start page. get access token here.
-get current tavern tier and save TIER as a state variable. (necessary? just loading minions is fine).
COOL FEATURE:
-WHEN WE MAKE A GETMINIONDATA REQUEST, SET MINIONS TO NULL.
-RENDER A BUTTON TO CONTINUE TO MINIONCHECKER ONLY IF MINIONS IF NOT NULL. OTHERWISE LOAD A SPINNER.
-make a request to HS API that gets all minions of relevant tier.
-render all minions and make them clickable so that user can select desired minions.
-perform some mathematics based on desired minions and return a success chance.


suggestions:
-maybe move the getMinionData dispatch and minions state to calculator from api.

Necessary dependencies:
redux and react-redux - for state management. INSTALLED.
redux-thunk - for asynchronous redux operations. INSTALLED.
client-oauth2 - for getting oauth access token from blizzard API. INSTALLED.
axios - for making API requests in general. INSTALLED.
